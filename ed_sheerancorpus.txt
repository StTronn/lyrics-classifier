Another day, another life Passes by just like mine It's not complicated Another mind, another soul Another body to grow old It's not complicated  Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down, like autumn leaves Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep And you're miles away And yesterday you were here with me  Another tear, another cry Another place for us to die It's not complicated Another life that's gone to waste Another light lost from your face It's complicated  Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you? Float down, like autumn leaves Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep And you're miles away And yesterday you were here with me  Ooh how I miss you My symphony played the song that carried you out Ooh how I miss you I miss you and I wish you'd stay  Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down, like autumn leaves Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep And you're miles away And yesterday you were here with me  Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down, like autumn leaves Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep And you're miles away And yesterday you were here with me  Touch down Like a seven four seven We'll stay out and we'll live forever now...I wanna be drunk when I wake up On the right side of the wrong bed And never an excuse I made up Tell you the truth I hate What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me So now I'll maybe lean back there I'm sat here, wishing I was sober I know I'll never hold you like I used to But our house gets cold when you cut the heating Without you to hold I'll be freezing Can't rely on my heart to beat it Cause you take part of it every evening Take words out of my mouth just from breathing Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?' Should I, Should I?  Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love  I wanna hold your heart in both hands Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can And I've got no plans for the weekend So should we speak then? Keep it between friends? Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to There may be other people like us Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before You don't hold me anymore On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name I know I can't heal things with a handshake You know I can't change, as I began saying You cut me wide open like a landscape Open bottles of beer but never champagne To applaud you with the sound that my hands make Should I? Should I?  Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love  All by myself I'm here again All by myself You know I'll never change All by myself All by myself  I'm just drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little loveGive me love like her 'Cause lately I've been waking up alone Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt Told you I'd let them go  And that I'll fight my corner Maybe tonight I'll call ya After my blood turns into alcohol No, I just wanna hold ya  Give a little time to me, or burn this out We'll play hide and seek to turn this around All I want is the taste that your lips allow  Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love  Give me love like never before 'Cause lately I've been craving more And it's been a while, but I still feel the same Maybe I should let you go  You know I'll fight my corner And that tonight I'll call ya After my blood is drowning in alcohol No, I just wanna hold ya  Give a little time to me, or burn this out We'll play hide and seek to turn this around All I want is the taste that your lips allow Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Give a little time to me, or burn this out We'll play hide and seek to turn this around All I want is the taste that your lips allow  Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love  M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover  Love me, love me Love me, give me love Give me love Give me love Love me Give me love  Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me loveSmoke alarm went off at nine I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye She left a note "I'll be back in 5" Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey  I was told to put my job in front of you But it won't hold me like you do  But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up When I see my friends, all they say is hold up Ed, remember the time When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?

in my hands, be as gentle as I can But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans A small bump in four months, you're brought to life  I'll whisper quietly I'll give you nothing but truth If you're not inside me I'll put my future in you  You are my one and only And you can wrap your fingers 'round my Thumb and hold me tight Oh, you are my one and only You can wrap your fingers 'round my Thumb and hold me tight And you'll be all right  You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes  And I'll hold you tightly I'll tell you nothing but truth If you're not inside me I'll put my future in you  You are my one and only And you can wrap your fingers round my Thumb and hold me tight Oh, you are my one and only You can wrap your fingers round my Thumb and hold me tight And you'll be all right  You can lie with me With your tiny feet When you're half asleep I'll leave you be Right in front of me For a couple weeks So I can keep you safe  'Cause you are my one and only You can wrap your fingers round my Thumb and hold me tight You are my one and only You can wrap your fingers round my Thumb and hold me tight And you'll be all right  You were just a small bump unborn Just four months then torn from life Maybe you were needed up there But we're still unaware as whyYou're not her, though I try to see you differently I tow the line, you see, I'm searching for what used to be mine And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her  I've moved far away from you And I want to see you here beside me, dear But things aren't clear  When we never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I'd miss you And I miss you  She was mine I was hers and all that's in between If she would cry I I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be  I've moved far away from you And I want to see you here beside me, dear But things aren't clear  We never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I'd miss you And I miss you  Don't drop me in, it's not my turn If you cut deep, then I might learn That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn Don't drop me in, it's not my turn And if you cut deep, then I might learn That you scar and leave me, like a sunburn  We never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I'd miss you And I miss you And I miss you And I miss you And I miss youWhite lips, pale face Breathing in the snowflakes Burnt lungs, sour taste Light's gone, days end Struggling to pay rent Long nights, strange men  And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately, her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us  'Cause we're just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple of grams And she don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly  Ripped gloves, raincoat Tried to swim and stay afloat Dry house, wet clothes Loose change, bank notes Weary-eyed, dry throat Call girl, no phone  And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately, her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us  'Cause we're just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple of grams And she don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly  An angel will die Covered in white Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life This time, we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line  And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately, her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us  And we're all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple of grams And we don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly Fly, fly For angels to fly To fly, to fly For angels to dieThis city never sleeps I hear the people walk by when it's late Sirens bleed through my windowsill I can't close my eyes Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive The lights that blind keep me awake Hood up and lace untied Sleep fills my mind Can't control what I'm into  London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home  I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps then that makes two  The pavement is my friend It will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up And puts me down This is not what I'm used to The shop across the road Fulfills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I don't think I'm gonna make it Past tomorrow  London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home  I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps then that makes two  And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled With the sound of the city life echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along  London calls me a stranger This is not my home, home  I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps then that makes twoOf all the money that e'er I had I spent it in good company And all the harm that e'er I've done Alas it was to none but me And all I've done for want of wit To memory now I can't recall So fill to me the parting glass Good night and joy be with you all  Of all the comrades that e'er I had They are sorry for my going away And all the sweethearts that e'er I had They would wish me one more day to stay But since it falls unto my lot That I should rise and you should not I'll gently rise and I'll softly call Good night and joy be with you all  A man may drink and not be drunk A man may fight and not be slain A man may court a pretty girl And perhaps be welcomed back again But since it has so ought to be By a time to rise and a time to fall Come fill to me the parting glass Good night and joy be with you all Good night and joy be with you allThis is the start of something beautiful This is the start of something new You are the one that make me lose it all You are the start of something new, ooh  And I throw it all away Watch you fall into my arms again And I throw it all away Watch you fall, now  You are the earth that I will stand upon You are the words that I will sing  And I've thrown it all away Watched you fall into his arms again And I've thrown it all away Watched you fall, now  And take me back Take me home Watch me fall, down to earth Take me back, home  This is start of something beautiful You are the start of something newI found your hairband on my bedroom floor The only evidence that you've been here before And I don't get waves of missing you anymore They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes Never getting dry, so I get high Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on Weeks pass in the blink of an eye And I'm still drunk at the end of the night I don't drink like everybody else I do it to forget things about myself Stumble and fall with head spin I've got My mind's with you but my heart's just not  So am I close to you anymore, if it's over And there's no chance that we'll work it out?  That's why you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied  Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that I never wanna settle down, come around Break up the love like Lego now Never wanna turn into another "like you" Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views Everything's great, not everything's sure But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus Now I'm in position to be another stalker Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous On the surface And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it Pain is only relevant if it still hurts I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss  So am I close to you anymore, if it's over And there's no chance that we'll work it out?  Oh, you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied  Because, if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh) And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered From all that I've done wrong And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one But I know God made another one of me To love you better than I ever will  'Cause you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I liedI should ink my skin with your name And take my passport out again And just replace it See I could do without a tan On my left hand Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath Fill it up with bubbles 'Cause maybe you're loveable Maybe you're my snowflake And your eyes turn from green to gray And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder  And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up  And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me Could you make me a cup of tea To open my eyes in the right way And I know you love Shrek 'Cause we've watched it 12 times And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too And if your DVD breaks today You should've got a VCR Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say I know I've always been shit at computer games And your brother always beats me And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you laugh at me And be asking me If I'm gonna be home next week And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up  And I think you hate the smell of smoke You always try and get me to stop But you drink as much as me And I get drunk a lot So I'll take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like this necklace So the heart falls where your chest is Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach And it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now Against yours now Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me upI don't want bruise your ears Or hurt you again But I got back-stabbed by a black cab When I needed a friend  Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now See me lose focus as I sing to you loud I can't, no, I won't hush I'll say the words that make you blush I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh) See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is I'm like glue, I stick to other artists I'm not you, now that would be disastrous Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me  Cause you need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you at all You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you at all You need me  I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School I came fast with the way I act, right I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe And I won't be a product of my genre My mind will always be stronger than my songs are Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating When I perform live, feels like I am meditating Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi  Cause you need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you at all You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you at all You need me  Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right I won't stop until my name's in lights With stadium heights, with Damien Rice On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah The game's over but now I'm on a new level Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal People think that I'm bound to blow up I've done around about a thousand shows but I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out Wow, from day one I've been prepared With V05 wax for my ginger hair So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of What the future holds cause it's another day Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache I hit back when the pen hurts me I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee I'm still the same as a year ago But more people hear me though According to the MySpace and YouTube videos I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio Melody music maker, reading all the papers They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator  'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you at all You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you at all You need me, man, I don't need youThings were all good yesterday And then the devil took your memory And if you fell to your death today I hope that heaven is your resting place I heard the doctors put your chest in pain But then that could've been the medicine And now you're lying in the bed again Either way I'll cry with the rest of them  And my father told me "son It's not his fault he doesn't know your face And you're not the only one" Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing  Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up And we're wrapped in light and life and love Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut For they're designed to be together, oh With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one And we're set alight, we're afire love Oh love  And things were all good yesterday But then the devil took your breath away And now we're left here in the pain Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain And now my family is one again Stapled together with the strangers and a friend Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen Six years old, I remember when  And my father told me "son It's not his fault he doesn't know your face And you're not the only one" Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing  Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up And we're wrapped in light and life and love Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut For they're designed to be together, oh With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one And we're set alight, we're afire love Oh love  And my father and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah And my mother and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah And my brother and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah And my father and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujahIt's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon I saw a shooting star and thought of you I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew If you were here, I'd sing to you You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two I'm miles away from seeing you But I can see the stars from America I wondered, do you see them too?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  I can hear your heart on the radio beat They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us Back to the time you were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew Everything led back to you So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? You're the song my heart is beating to  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  And oh, I know And oh, I know And oh I can see the stars From AmericaI've been spinning now for time Couple women by my side I got sinning on my mind Sipping on red wine I've been sitting here for ages Ripping out the pages How'd I get so faded? How'd I get so faded?  Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now If you loved me how'd you never learn Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes One or two could free my mind  This is how it ends I feel the chemicals Burn in my bloodstream Fading out again I feel the chemicals Burn in my bloodstream So tell me when it kicks in Tell me when it kicks in  I've been looking for a lover Thought I'd find her in a bottle God, make

that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later, returned I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn But I gave her my time for two or three nights Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again She told me, "I was never looking for a friend Maybe you could swing by my room around ten Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM" Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe  And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza Before a text message was the only way to reach her Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either But me and her, we make money the same way Four cities, two planes, the same day And those shows have never been what it's about But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out When she was kissing him, how I was confused about Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe  (Knock knock knock) on my hotel door I don't even know if she knows what for She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya Trust and respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next (you bastard) But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard) Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course It's not like we were both on tour We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different This is not the way you realised what you wanted It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest And all this time, God knows I'm singing  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babeAcross the sea by the Tennessee skyline They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams But I'd long to be, in the bed of my true love Back where I came from, she's waiting for me  So I'll make my way through long winding country roads But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose  I told my dad on the phone it's amazing From the street to the craziest places I've seen But I'd long to be, in the arms of my true love Like he loves my mother, he understands me  I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose  I met a man in the bar down in Memphis He told me he went there to follow his dreams He told me "son, you know I lost my true love For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"  And I found truth in people I barely know But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose  Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English roseIt's alright to cry Even my dad does sometimes So don't wipe your eyes Tears remind you you're alive It's alright to die 'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried But just for tonight, hold on  So live life like you're giving up 'Cause you act like you are Go ahead and just live it up Go on and tear me apart  It's alright to shake Even my hand does sometimes So inside we'll rage Against the dying of the light It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried But just for today, hold on  So live life like you're giving up 'Cause you act like you are Go ahead and just live it up Go on and tear me apart, and hold on So live life like you're giving up 'Cause you act like you are Go ahead and just live it up Go on and tear me apart, and hold onOh misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over Durin's sons  If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out father oh, stand by and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side  And if we should die tonight, we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out father oh, prepare as we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me  Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me  And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes For if the dark returns then my brothers will die And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out  Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin) I see fire And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainsideOh, I'm a mess right now, inside out Searching for a sweet surrender but this is not the end I can't work it out, how Going through the motions, going through us  And oh, I've known it for the longest time And all of my hopes, all of my words Are all over written on the signs When you're on my road walking me home Home, home, home, home  See the flames inside my eyes It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar But for tonight I wanna fall in love Put your faith in my stomach  I messed up this time, late last night Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined I can't shake this feeling, now We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop  And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know That all of my words will always be low Of all the love we spoke When you're on my road walking me home Home, home, home, home  See the flames inside my eyes It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar But for tonight I wanna fall in love Put your faith in my stomach  And

Or maybe we should take a ride through the night And sing along to every song that's on the radio In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn Oh no no, the sun could rise Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM So DJ, play it again  Until the night turns into morning You'll be in my arms We'll just keep driving Along the boulevard And if I kissed you, darling Please don't be alarmed It's just the start Of everything if you want A new love In New York  Yesterday, you gave me a call Stressing out about it all Said the world is moving too fast And you don't know where to begin Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in Only to wind up on the other side By yourself And every day Screaming out To all the people that you used to know From a window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline It's just the way that life goes And you live it in every song you know So DJ, play it again  Until the night turns into morning You'll be in my arms We'll just keep driving Along the boulevard And if I kissed you, darling Please don't be alarmed It's just the start Of everything if you want A new life In New York  And every song that plays Is just like the day you had And it's okay to cry But I'm saying maybe that's A waste of water You know I'm here for you In the back of the taxi cab tonight In New York  It's just reached the morning And you're still in my arms And we've stopped driving Down the boulevard And I just kissed you, darling I hope you weren't alarmed It's just the start Of everything that you want A new love In New YorkI met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder? Under the covers where we used to lay And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe We used each other's air just for the people to see And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep We go anywhere, our minds would take us And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that God made us And time's the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again  Oh Nina You should go, Nina Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road, Nina But then again you should know, Nina Cause that's you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now?  And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics I disappear, you call me selfish I understand but I can't help it I put my job over everything except my family and friends But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back Overlook the situation Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane But in a day we'll have to say it again  Oh Nina You should go, Nina Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road, Nina But then again you should know, Nina Cause that's you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now?  Love will come and love will go But you can't make it on your own Sing that song, go Oh won't you leave me now? People grow and fall apart But you can't mend your broken heart Take it back, go Oh won't you leave me now?  Oh Nina You should go, Nina (Love will come and Love will go) Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh, won't you leave me now?

(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now) And I've been living on the road, Nina (People grow and fall apart) But then again you should know, Nina (But you can mend your broken heart) Cause that's you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now?Tell me that you'll turn down the man Who asks for your hand Cause you're waiting for me And I know, you're gonna be away a while But I've got no plans at all to leave And would you take away my hopes and dreams? And just stay with me  All my senses come to life While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I Have ever been and I'll never leave again Cause you are the only one And all my friends have gone to find Another place to let their hearts collide Just promise me, you'll never leave again Cause you are the only one  Take my hand and my Heart and soul, I will Only have these eyes for you And you know, everything changes but We'll be strangers if we see this through You could stay within these walls and bleed Or just stay with me, oh Lord now  All my senses come to life While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I Have ever been and I'll never leave again Cause you are the only one And all my friends have gone to find Another place to let their hearts collide Just promise me, you'll always be a friend Cause you are the only one  Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost I am so gone, so tell me the way home I listen to sad songs, singing about love And where it goes wrong  All my senses come to life While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I Have ever been and I'll never leave again Cause you are the only one And all my friends have gone to find Another place to let their hearts collide Just promise me, you'll always be a friend Cause you are the only oneLoving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes But it's the only thing that I know When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes It is the only thing that makes us feel alive  We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Our hearts were never broken And time's forever frozen, still  So you can keep me Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans Holding me close until our eyes meet You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home  Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul And it's the only thing that I know, know I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya And it's the only thing to take with us when we die  We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Our hearts were never broken And time's forever frozen, still  So you can keep me Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans Holding me close until our eyes meet You won't ever be alone And if you hurt me, that's okay baby Only words bleed inside these pages You just hold me And I won't ever let you go Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home  Oh you can fit me Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen Next to your heartbeat where I should be Keep it deep within your soul And if you hurt me, that's okay baby Only words bleed inside these pages You just hold me And I won't ever let you go  When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me Under the lamppost back on Sixth street Hearing you whisper through the phone Wait for me to come homeI've known it for a long time Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine Disappearing all night I don't wanna know where he's been lying I know what I wanna do Wanna runaway, runaway with you Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go  How long you leaving? Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but  I love him from my skin to my bones But I don't wanna live in his home There's nothing to say cause he knows I'll just runaway and be on my own  I've never seen my dad cry Cold as stone in the kitchen light I'll tell you it's about time But I was raised to keep quiet This is what I'm gonna do Gonna runaway, gonna make that move Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go  How long you leaving?

LOUDER! SING!  This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke Let it go until our roads are changed Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you" Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila I already know if she's a keeper Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in Deep shit if anybody finds out I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth  I need you darling Come on, set the tone If you feel you're fallin' Won't you let me know If you love me Come on, get involved Feel it rushin' through you From your head to toe  SING! LOUDER! SING!  Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back But can you feel it?

I need you darling Come on, set the tone If you feel you're fallin' Won't you let me know LOUDER! SING! If you love me Come on, get involved Feel it rushin' through you From your head to toe LOUDER! SING!I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen The studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I'll do my own thing now and get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked And went from sleeping at a subway station to Sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh  I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack I'll be singing the news Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering "everything that happens is from now on" I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong But then I've never had an enemy except the NME But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be With all these spectacles ahead of me and festival fees Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh  Now I don't ever wanna be perfect Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written Now absence can make your heart ache but drinking Absinthe Can change your mind state vividly, need to let my liver be And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams But, but I just write schemes, I'm never having A stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made And every single second knowing that we'll never betray The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh  My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget ninety percent of it when we wake But the other ten percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow IGH!You look so wonderful in your dress I love your hair like that The way it falls on the side of your neck Down your shoulders and back We are surrounded by all of these lies And people that talk too much You got the kind of look in your eyes As if no one knows anything but us  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love So in love So in love So in love  You look so beautiful in this light You silhouette over me The way it brings out the blue in your eyes Is the Tenerife sea And all of the voices surrounding us here They just fade out when you take a breath Just say the word and I will disappear Into the wilderness  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love So in love So in love So in love  Lumiere darling Lumiere over me Lumiere darling Lumiere over me Lumiere darling Lumiere over me  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love So in love So in love So in love  You look so wonderful in your dress I love your hair like that And in a moment I knew you, BethNow I don't wanna hate you Just wish you'd never gone for the man And waited two weeks at least Before you let him take you I stayed true, I kind of knew You liked the dude from private school He's waiting for the time to move I knew he had his eyes on you He's not the right guy for you Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth No, I would never lie to you But it was never fine to lose you And what a way to find out It never came from my mouth You never changed your mind But you were just afraid to mind out But  it I won't be changing the subject, I love it I'll make your little secret public It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons You sleep with in your closet to get back at me Trapped and I'm lacking sleep Fact is you're mad at me Because I backtrack so casually You're practically my family If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot? I think not  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  Recently I tend to zone out Up in my headphones to Holocene You promised your body but I'm away so much I stay more celibate than in a monastery I'm not cut out for life on the road 'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much And at the time we'd just go, so sue me I guess I'm not the man that you need Ever since you went to uni I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad But when I broke the industry That's when I broke your heart I was supposed to chart and celebrate But good things are over fast I know it's hard to deal with and see this I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus I never really want to believe this Got advice from my dad and he Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  And since you left, I've given up my days off It's what I need to stay strong I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook 'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could The irony is if my career in music didn't exist In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill Go down in history as just a wasted talent Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ? It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change  Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no AnymoreWhen your legs don't work like they used to before And I can't sweep you off of your feet Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three And I'm thinking 'bout how  People fall in love in mysterious ways Maybe just the touch of a hand Well me, I fall in love with you every single day I just wanna tell you I am  So honey, now, take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud And maybe we found love right where we are  When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades And the crowds don't remember my name When my hands don't play the strings the same way I know you will still love me the same 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory And I'm thinking 'bout how  People fall in love in mysterious ways And maybe it's all part of a plan Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes Hoping that you'll understand  That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud And maybe we found love right where we are  So baby, now, take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud That maybe we found love right where we are Oh baby, we found love right where we are And

lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again And tomorrow's a brand new day  Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind" And I am only being honest with you, I I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye Bibia be ye ye  I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon Looking around for the things that I left on the ground And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day  Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind" And I am only being honest with you, I I get

brother and his friends And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down I was younger then, take me back to when I  Found my heart and broke it here Made friends and lost them through the years And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown But I can't wait to go home  I'm on my way Driving at 90 down those country lanes Singing to "Tiny Dancer" And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right But I was younger then, take me back to when  We found weekend jobs, when we got paid We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown But I can't wait to go home  I'm on my way Driving at 90 down those country lanes Singing to "Tiny Dancer" And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill  One friend left to sell clothes One works down by the coast One had two kids but lives alone One's brother overdosed One's already on his second wife One's just barely getting by But these people raised me And I can't wait to go home  And I'm on my way, I still remember These old country lanes When we did not know the answers And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hillOh, maybe I came on too strong Maybe I waited too long Maybe I played my cards wrong Oh, just a little bit wrong Baby I apologize for it  I could fall, or I could fly Here in your aeroplane And I could live, I could die Hanging on the words you say And I've been known to give my all And jumping in harder than Ten thousand rocks on the lake  So

Oh, honestly? Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song It goes on and on  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf No farewell So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself  I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain 'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same And only scars remain  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf No farewell So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself  But if I don't Then I'll go back To where I'm rescuing a stranger Just because they needed saving just like that Oh, I'm here again Between the devil and the danger But I guess it's just my nature My dad was wrong 'Cause I'm not like my mum 'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song But it helps So before I save someone else I've got to save myself  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf No farewell So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself And before I love someone else, I've got to love myselfThe club isn't the best place to find a lover So the bar is where I go Me and my friends at the table doing shots Drinking fast and then we talk slow And you come over and start up a conversation with just me And trust me I'll give it a chance now Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like  Girl, you know I want your love Your love was handmade for somebody

something brand new I'm in love with the shape of youI took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill I threw the day old tea from the cup Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life that's been loved Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer down the sink Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down" But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink  Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved  So I'll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go When God takes you back He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"  I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek And wiped a tear from the side of my face  I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know A life with love is a life that's been lived  So I'll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go When God takes you back He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"  Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum You got to see the person I have become Spread your wings and I know That when God took you back He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"
